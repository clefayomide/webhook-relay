Webhook Relay
</p>

## ðŸ§© Overview

Webhook Relay is a plug-and-play, open-source template designed for **payment companies, SaaS platforms, and fintech startups**. It unifies inconsistent webhook structures from various payment gateways into a **standardized event format**, so you can scale integrations faster and maintain consistency across your stack.

Currently, it includes webhook setup support for:

- Interswitch Payment Gateway (IPG)

## âœ¨ Features

- Signature validation middleware according to gateway standard

- Custom event mapping per gateway

- Database-agnostic design â€“ bring your own storage logic (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, etc.)

- Easily extensible for multiple payment gateways

- Designed to be self-hosted and audit-friendly
